# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.

# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore composer and bundle files
/php/www/vendor/*
/rails/vendor/*

# Ignore bundler config.
/rails/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/rails/log/*
/rails/tmp/*
!/rails/log/.keep
!/rails/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/rails/tmp/pids/*
!/rails/tmp/pids/
!/rails/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/rails/storage/*
!/rails/storage/.keep

/rails/public/assets
/rails/.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
